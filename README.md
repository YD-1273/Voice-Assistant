# Voice-Assistant
This project features Ana, a simple voice assistant script in Python. It uses pyttsx3 for text-to-speech, speech_recognition for voice input processing, and MySQL Connector for database interaction. Ana can greet the user based on the time of day and respond to basic commands like "hello" and "hey."
